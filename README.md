## App Brainstorming (Step 4)
1. Google Map:
- Being able to saved the spots/locations into multiple lists
- Being able to search up spots in specific areas by zooming into the area that we want, and it also shows the ratings.

2. Beli:
- Customized ranking based on three sections: don't like, okay, and like
- Being able to claim reservations of several restaurants that other people give out on the app

3. Instagram:
- The user can see how their intended post will look like on their profile before posting. \
- Professional users can create a guide. For example, I have seen food influencers creating a restaurant guide, which is really useful and interesting for a foodie like me. 

App that I want to build: a baking app that brings together baking enthusiasts, both amateurs and professionals. The app will display several baking recommendations + tips and also allows the users to share and rate their recipes. There can also be some virtual baking challenges for the participants to try to make the given dessers and the app community can vote for the winners.  

## Notes

- It was kinda hard to figure out where things are in Xcode because it was my first time using it, but it was really fun exploring!
